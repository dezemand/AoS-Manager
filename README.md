# AoS-Manager
Ace of Spades (0.7.5 &amp; 0.7.6) Server Manager is made for server admins that are running 1 or more Ace of Spades servers. This is using the old version of Ace of Spades, which is not developed by Jagex. This version is mainly maintained by [Build and Shoot](http://buildandshoot.com/). The recommended server software is [PySnip](https://bitbucket.org/NateShoffner/pysnip/), a branch of the older PySpades server software.

## How to

1. Clone this repo ``git clone https://github.com/netraameht/AoS-Manager.git``
2. Make sure you have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) on your machine (``npm --version``)
3. Run ``npm install`` inside your repo to install all dependencies
4. Run ``npm start`` to start the app on port 80 (temporary port)

## To do

 - [ ] Start working on auto downloading & building PySnip
 - [ ] Create interface for manager
 - [ ] Fancy up main interface
 - [ ] Cool authorization system for manager
